You could even use default arguments in your `calculate_score` function if that makes the code cleaner.\n",

You can do some error checking after receiving each answer to make sure it is compatible with what `calculate_score` expects, and if not, you can try to convert it into an appropriate response or ask the user a follow-up question to clarify.\n",

If your program made a decision about resource allocation, consider which people might receive the most harm/benefit from its scoring algorithm.
